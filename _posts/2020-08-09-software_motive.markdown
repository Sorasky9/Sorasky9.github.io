To many, a motivation to be a software engineer is to be an expert at it in exchange for getting compensated very well. There is nothing wrong with that. However as for me, i am a little bit different. Like many, I do want to be an expert in software engineering. I also want to use such valuable skill also to help anywhere in God's kingdom. As a christian man that is after God's heart, I do believe God wants us to enjoy life! There is so much this life can offer and I am grateful for every moment of it. I am also a person who likes to give back and for God to give me life and wants me to enjoy it, I want to do something by, out of my free will of choice, to contribute in anything in God's kingdom . Whether it may be creating a website and mobile apps to help win and draw in souls towards Him, i would be more than happy to get involved in such projects. Not that to say i won't participate in other secular (not too secular) projects such as phone carriers and other companies that need a website to be updated or simply start from scratch. Needless to say, this is my motivation and i look forward to this journey! Be well and God bless!
